# Getting Started with PHP Development

PHP is one of the most popular server-side programming languages, powering over 78% of all websites. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, PHP provides the tools and flexibility you need.

## What is PHP?

PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. It's embedded within HTML and executed on the server, making it perfect for dynamic web applications.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you start coding, you'll need to set up your development environment:

### 1. Install PHP

You can install PHP on various platforms:

- **Windows**: Use XAMPP or WAMP
- **macOS**: Use Homebrew: `brew install php`
- **Linux**: Use your package manager: `sudo apt-get install php`

### 2. Choose a Code Editor

Popular choices include:
- Visual Studio Code
- PhpStorm
- Sublime Text
- Atom

## Basic PHP Syntax

PHP code is enclosed in `<?php` and `?>` tags:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

### Variables and Data Types

```php
<?php
$name = "OgÃ¼n";
$age = 25;
$isActive = true;
$height = 5.9;
?>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful variable names**
2. **Follow PSR standards**
3. **Validate and sanitize user input**
4. **Use prepared statements for database queries**
5. **Keep your code organized with functions and classes**

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered the basics, consider learning:
- Object-Oriented Programming in PHP
- PHP frameworks like Laravel or Symfony
- Database integration with MySQL
- RESTful API development

Happy coding!
